# HTTP5202-No-Tears

_Tollo_ will be a fitness application for weight-lifting, strength-training, and fitness. Most applications are either solely about set programs, ask users to pick from exercises only the programmers have put into its database, or are otherwise devoted calorie-counting apps. _Tollo_ will merge these goals and functions while giving users more power to upload and manage their exercises and chart their progress. Members will be able to save routines and note their progress, allowing _Tollo_ to structure and enhance their success.

Our audience will be novice to expert weightlifters, athletes, and anyone serious about strength training.
